### Focusteck Bootcamp Portfolio
Hey! I'm Minahal Fatima. Welcome to my coding portfolio! This repository contains assignments and hands-on projects completed during the Bootcamp. 
Each task focuses on practical skill-building using real concepts in Git, GitHub, JavaScript, DOM, and Node.js.

### Week 1 – Foundation & JS Basics

*Assignment Plan (Tue–Fri)* 
A week dedicated to setting up developer tools, learning Git/GitHub workflows, and covering JavaScript fundamentals.
  * Git, GitHub & JavaScript Basics
  * JavaScript Control Flow & Arrays
  * JavaScript Objects & DOM Manipulation
  * Node.js & File System

### Week2 - Building Full-Stack Skills
*Assignment Plan (Tue–Fri)*

This week focuses on building a full-stack application using  React (frontend),  Node.js/Express 
(backend), and  PostgreSQL (database). The schedule  is reorganised to introduce 
Authentication and JWT should be done earlier for better structuring  and smoother weekly implementation.

### Monday: React Fundamentals

* Created a React app (task-manager) with functional components.
* Implemented task list management with useState.
* Added task addition and deletion functionality.

### Tuesday: React Data Fetching & Effects

* Enhanced React app to fetch tasks from JSONPlaceholder API.
* Added loading states, error handling, and React Router.
* Created multiple routes and implemented task completion toggle.

### Wednesday: Node.js & Express Backend + Authentication

* Built an Express server with RESTful API endpoints.
* Implemented JWT authentication middleware.
* Tested API endpoints using Postman.

### Thursday: Database Integration with PostgreSQL

* Set up PostgreSQL locally and designed tasks table.
* Connected Express backend to PostgreSQL using node-postgres.
* Updated API endpoints to interact with the database.

# Friday: Full-Stack-App

This project is a full-stack task management app built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. It features secure JWT-based authentication, dynamic task creation, deletion, and completion toggle functionality. The frontend is connected to a protected backend API and includes proper loading states and error handling for all operations. The application follows best practices in code structure, state management, and deployment readiness.
