# Focusteck Bootcamp Portfolio
Hey! I'm Minahal Fatima. Welcome to my coding portfolio! This repository contains assignments and hands-on projects completed during the Bootcamp. 
Each task focuses on practical skill-building using real concepts in Git, GitHub, JavaScript, DOM, and Node.js.

# Week 1 – Foundation & JS Basics

*Assignment Plan (Tue–Fri)* 
A week dedicated to setting up developer tools, learning Git/GitHub workflows, and covering JavaScript fundamentals.

# Week2 - Building Full-Stack Skills
*Assignment Plan (Tue–Fri)*

This week focuses on building a full-stack application using  React (frontend),  Node.js/Express 
(backend), and  PostgreSQL (database). The schedule  is reorganised to introduce 
Authentication and JWT should be done earlier for better structuring  and smoother weekly implementation.

# Full-Stack-App

This project is a full-stack task management app built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. It features secure JWT-based authentication, dynamic task creation, deletion, and completion toggle functionality. The frontend is connected to a protected backend API and includes proper loading states and error handling for all operations. The application follows best practices in code structure, state management, and deployment readiness.
